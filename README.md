CloudShare API v3 SDKs
======================

This repository provides three "low level" API SDKs, each has a single function that both handles the HTTPS-requests for `use.cloudshare.com/api/v3/...` and takes care of the authentication. 
The SDK source files are free and open source software. They are licensed under the MIT License (`http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT`).

Each directory contians a language specific implementation and has its own README.md file, in order to help you get started quickly.
