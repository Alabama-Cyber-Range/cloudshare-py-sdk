CloudShare API v3 SDKs
======================

This repository provides three "low level" API SDKs, each has a single function that both handles the HTTPS-requests for `use.cloudshare.com/api/v3/...` and takes care of the authentication. 
The SDK source files are open source software. They are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Each directory contains a language specific implementation and has its own README.md file, in order to help you get started quickly.
