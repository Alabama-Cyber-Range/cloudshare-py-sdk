CloudShare API v3 SDKs
======================

This repository provides three "low level" API SDKs. Each of them provides a single function that HTTP-requests `use.cloudshare.com/api/v3/...` and takes care of authentication for you. You can use them as-is or modify or learn them. 

You'll find each directory holds a README.md file of its own with the aim of helping you get started quickly.
